# materials-of-SCTIE-irregular-array
Several figures of SCTIE irregular array are given here.
Fig. A: Optimized array tiling topologies of SCTIE-shaped irregular array when (a) delta = 2 and (b) delta = 5 with the size of M ×N = 20×20 and element spacing dx = dy = 0.5λ. The serial number of the subarray is texted on the lattice.
Fig. B: Optimized array tiling topology of SCTIE-shaped irregular array when delta = 2 with the size of M ×N = 36×36 and element spacing dx =dy= 0.5λ. The serial number of the subarray is texted on the lattice.
Fig. C: Sketch of an example for multiple layers of feeding network of 4×4 SCTIE-shaped irregular array (detla = 2).
